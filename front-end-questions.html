  <h2>GENERAL QUESTIONS:</h2>
<a name="general"></a>


  <ul>
    <li>What did you learn yesterday/this week?</li>

    <li>What excites or interests you about coding?</li>
    <p> The ability to create something out of nothing and then nurture it and see if grow and evolve, somewhat like being a gardener, but in which you are the creator of your own plants.</p>

    <li>What is a recent technical challenge you experienced and how did you solve it?</li>

    <li>What UI, Security, Performance, SEO, Maintainability or Technology considerations do you make while building a web application or site?</li>

    <p>    I like to adhere by Kent Beck’s maxim:

      Make it Work.  Make it Right.  Make it Fast.

      In other words, I tend to focus first on just shipping something, to determine if this even is what the customer wants.  Then, we can refactor and optimize and think about performance, security, etc.  One constant consideration I am making, in regards to maintainability: every time some code appears more than once, that’s a flag and I usually add a Todo to the backlog to come back and make it DRY.  Same thing with if I have a function that does more than one thing well, I’ll likely want to refactor that also.</p>

      <li>Talk about your preferred development environment.</li>
      <p>I like I nicely customized command line (eg one that displays the name of your current branch), lots of screen real estate (eg one screen for live reloading of app views and another for code), and automated testing that is running continually in the background.</p>

      <li>Which version control systems are you familiar with?</li>

      <p>Git</p>

      <li>Can you describe your workflow when you create a web page?</li>

      <p>Most likely I will have general layout template that I will use as a starting point (eg a landing page template, a detail page template.)  Then, I focus on creating some solid, semantically meaningful, and well structured markup. After that, I’ll apply styles, and finally behaviors with JS. In most cases, though, it’s more iterative and less linear than this 1-2-3 approach.</p>

      <li>If you have 5 different stylesheets, how would you best integrate them into the site?</li>

      <p>I would import them as partials into a main stylesheets using Sass.  I would also be consider refactoring the CSS in the respective stylesheets, to prevent duplicated css.</p>

      <li>Can you describe the difference between progressive enhancement and graceful degradation?</li>
      <p>Graceful degradation is more of a waterfall-oriented model, while Progressive Enhancement is more aligned with Agile and Iterative methods.

        Graceful degradation is when you have a fancy feature, such as a tab-based layout, but which would degrade to a stacked layout for a browser that can’t support whatever is generating the tabs.  In other words, it allows users with an inferior browser (or user agent)  to still access app content, but with a possibly more basic UI.

        Progressive enhancement is very similar, but rather than starting with the fancy feature and then adding a fall-back for people with browsers that don’t support it, you start with the very basic design, and maybe even ship that as your first release, and then progressively enhance the design as you go. So, in the above example, we may have shipped a very nicely designed page with stacked content (and anchor tag links) and then later added the tabs.</p>

        Progressive enhancement is a strategy for web design that emphasizes core webpage content first. This strategy then progressively adds more nuanced and technically rigorous layers of presentation and features on top of the content as the end-user's browser/internet connection allow.<br>
        Graceful degradation is the ability of a computer, machine, electronic system or network to maintain limited functionality even when a large portion of it has been destroyed or rendered inoperative. The purpose of graceful degradation is to prevent catastrophic failure. 
        <li>How would you optimize a website's assets/resources?</li>

        Lower file size of images/create a sprite. File concatenation, file compression, CDN Hosting, offloading assets, re-organizing and refining code, etc.

        <li>How many resources will a browser download from a given domain at a time?
          What are the exceptions?</li>

          <li>Name 3 ways to decrease page load (perceived or actual load time).</li>
          1. Reduce perceived download time: Add a some visual feedback, either a spinner or an actual progress, bar that displays during page load.<br /><br />
          2. Load static content first: Ensure that static page content loads first and then load additional assets in the background afterwards.<br /><br />
          3. Reduce the quantity of items to load:  Eg combine all js files into a single file, all css files into a single file, etc), to reduce the number of requests that the browser needs to make.

          <li>If you jumped on a project and they used tabs and you used spaces, what would you do?</li>
          I’d use tabs, but I would also inquire as to why tabs were being used and check to see if there was any interest in switching to using spaces for new projects.

          <li>Describe how you would create a simple slideshow page.</li>

          1. In the main page content area, add an unordered list containing slide show content.<br /><br />
          2. Add some CSS that hides all li selectors by default.<br /><br />
          3. Add some JS that show the first li selector by default.<br /><br />
          4. Add events that allow for hiding the current li selector and showing the next/previous selector.

          <li>If you could master one technology this year, what would it be?</li>
          React
          <li>Explain the importance of standards and standards bodies.</li>
          Standards is what allows me to use the same markup across many browsers and know with a reasonable amount of certainty that the page will render identically or similarly.  It reduces the need for checking what user agent is in use and modifying the markup/code to suit.  It also allow a completely new developer to come on board to a project and still be able write markup or code that is consistent with that of other developers.
          <li>What is Flash of Unstyled Content? How do you avoid FOUC?</li>
          This occurs when a page is rendered in the browser before styling has been applied. Sometimes it can be caused by that some of the css rendering is dependent on JavaScript, but the JS is not being loaded until at the end of the page, so you get this brief unstyled moment.  One way to avoid it is to display a loading message until all page content is ready to be viewed.
          <li>Explain what ARIA and screenreaders are, and how to make a website accessible.</li>
          Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) defines ways to make Web content and Web applications (especially those developed with Ajax and JavaScript) more accessible to people with disabilities. ... ARIA is a set of special accessibility attributes which can be added to any markup, but is especially suited to HTML.<br /><br />
          Screenreaders are what someone who is blind would use to read rather than view a page.  For these users, it can be very helpful to include things like a “Jump to main content” anchor tag at the very beginning of the markup to allow them to not have to navigate through all the header content (which might contain, say, a dropdown with links to every page in the site.)  Additionally, it is for these users in particular that one should be sure to always include alt tags for images and icons.

          <li>Explain some of the pros and cons for CSS animations versus JavaScript animations.</li>
          A CSS animation will likely require much less code since you are leveraging the browser’s graphics engine. However, they are really only suited for a more standard animation, such as a left-right transitions.  JS animations will increase page weight, since you are providing all the code for the animation, but they are better suited for something very customized where you need a lot of control.

          <li>What does CORS stand for and what issue does it address?</li>

          Cross Origin Resource Sharing refers to when secure data is being requested from a domain other than the domain from which the content is being served.  Since these types of requests can be a sign that you are being hacked, you will want to have some kind of token handshake (eg client/secret) between your domain and the other domain, to ensure they are trusted.


        </ul>


<a name="html"></a>
        <h1>HTML QUESTIONS:</h1>

        <ul>
          <li>What does a doctype do?</li>
          The doctype, which must appears at the very begining of your markup, defines what type of markup you will be using, eg HTML5 or XHTML, etc.  You can also inform robots about things like the main language in use, such as lang=”en”.

<li>What is the purpose of 'aside' tag in HTML5?</li>
This tag represents a piece of content that is only slightly related to the rest of the page.

           <li>What is image map?</li>


 
Image map lets you link to many different web pages using a single image. You can define shapes in images that you want to make part of an image mapping.


<li>What is the advantage of collapsing white space?</li>

White spaces are blank sequence of space characters, which is actually treated as a single space character in html. Because the browser collapses multiple space into a single space, you can indent lines of text without worrying about multiple spaces. This enables you to organize the html code into a much more readable format.

          <li>What's the difference between standards mode and quirks mode?</li>


          Quirks mode also known as Compatibility Mode - means your page is running without a document type declared(this is old school, so this is most likely not needed anymore) The whole point of quirks mode is that it's a compatibility mode for IE5. This means that in addition to changing the layout mode, it also switches off most of the browser features that have been invented since IE5. In quirks mode, the web browser attempts to render/make code based on a ‘best-guess’, this includes a generous interpretation of code that may be non-standard or poorly-formed. if you don't declare a doctype, the browser will have to guess what version of HTML/CSS you're running Quirks mode enables older HTML documents to still ‘work its a technique used by web browsers to maintain backward compatibility with older webpages.

          <li>What's the difference between HTML and XHTML?</li>
          XHTML is a sub-set of XML and was an attempt at making markup rules more strict, such as requiring inline closing tags for br tag (ie “<br />”), but then HTML5 came along, and XML was mostly overtaken by JSON for web app data exchange, and XHTML has since also fallen out of vogue.

          <li>Are there any problems with serving pages as application/xhtml+xml?</li>

          <li>How do you serve a page with content in multiple languages?</li>
          Well, first, you want to make sure your page will support all the various characters of the language, so be sure to set character encoding to utf-8 at the very beginning. You also want to inform robots of the various languages in use in the doctype.  Other than that, I’d say it’s implementation and domain-specific.

          <li>What kind of things must you be wary of when design or developing for multilingual sites?</li>
          First, be sure you can support all the characters of the various languages.  Second, make sure your site layout can respond to differences in the amount of real estate needed for content blocks.  (Ie one language may require several lines for a certain content block, while another may just require one.)  Last and definitely not least, the site layout will need to for both left and right reading directions, so if you switch from English to, say, Hebrew, you may want to flip certain components to accommodate the switch in reading direction.

          <li>What are data- attributes good for?</li>

          The data-* attributes gives us the ability to embed custom data attributes on all HTML elements. The stored (custom) data can then be used in the page's JavaScript to create a more engaging user experience (without any Ajax calls or server-side database queries).
<br/><br/>
          &lt;div id="myDiv" data-user="jsDude" data-list-size="5" data-maxage="180"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
          
          They’re great for passing contextual data to, for example, JS event handler.

          The data-* attributes gives us the ability to embed custom data attributes on all HTML elements. The stored (custom) data can then be used in the page's JavaScript to create a more engaging user experience (without any Ajax calls or server-side database queries).

          <li>Consider HTML5 as an open web platform. What are the building blocks of HTML5?</li>

          The main building blocks are the new tags, such as Article, Header, Nav, Section, etc.  Additionally, HTML5 provides the ability for accessing more advanced browser-native UI components, such as sliders and date-pickers, as well as access to improved form validation, eg having the browser check if an email address is validly formed.



          <li>Describe the difference between a cookie, sessionStorage and localStorage.</li>
          A cookie is a piece of data that has been stored in a user’s local browser, and which can be used to personalize an app or site for users’ viewing it in that browser.  sessionStorage and localStorage are ways of storing data locally, one for the current session only, the other permanently (or until deleted.)

          <li>Describe the difference between &lt;script&gt;, &lt;script async&gt; and &lt;script defer&gt;?</li>

          The async attribute is a boolean attribute.<br/>

          When present, it specifies that the script will be executed asynchronously as soon as it is available.<br/><br/>

          The defer attribute is a boolean attribute.<br/>

          When present, it specifies that the script is executed when the page has finished parsing.

          <li>Why is it generally a good idea to position CSS &lt;link&gt;s between &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt; and JS &lt;script&gt;s just before &lt;/body&gt;? Do you know any exceptions?</li>

          CSS should be loaded in the head section to so that styling can be loaded before the page body loads, else the page will appear without styling.  JS should be loaded after all content has loaded, ie just before the closing body tag, so that loading of possibly large JS files does not initial page load.

          <li>What is progressive rendering?</li>
          This is when you initially load a lower resolution version of an image, and then progressively add resolution to the image, which prevents the user from just seeing no image until the entire image has loaded.

          <li>Have you used different HTML templating languages before?</li>
          (Moustache, Hangdlebars, Underscrore)

        </ul>


<a name="css"></a>
        <h1>CSS QUESTIONS:</h1>

        <ul>
          <li>What is the difference between classes and ID's in CSS?</li>
          Classes effect multiple elements, ID's effect only 1.


          <li>What's the difference between "resetting" and "normalizing" CSS? Which would you choose, and why?</li>
          A CSS Reset (or “Reset CSS”) is a short, often compressed (minified) set of CSS rules that resets the styling of all HTML elements to a consistent baseline.

          Normalize.css preserves useful defaults rather than "unstyling" everything. For example, elements like sup or sub "just work" after including normalize.css (and are actually made more robust) whereas they are visually indistinguishable from normal text after including reset.css. So, normalize.css does not impose a visual starting point (homogeny) upon you. This may not be to everyone's taste. The best thing to do is experiment with both and see which gels with your preferences.

          <li>Describe Floats and how they work.</li>

          Floats bring an element to the left or right of its boundry box and allows text and inline elements to flow around it.

          <li>Describe z-index and how stacking context is formed.</li>
          Z-index defines if an element is above or below, layers. Position not static.<br /><br />

          So what is a stacking context? A stacking context is an element that contains a set of layers. This can be a root stacking context, as created by the html element. Or it can be a local stacking context, as created by specific properties and values.

          "Contains a stack of layers" is a weird phrase, but a simple concept. Within a local stacking context, the z-index values of its children are set relative to that element rather than to the document root. Layers outside of that context — i.e. sibling elements of a local stacking context — can't sit between layers within it.



          <li>Describe BFC(Block Formatting Context) and how it works.</li>
          A Block Formatting Context is part of the visual CSS rendering of a web page in which block boxes are laid out. The positioning scheme to which it belongs is normal flow. According to W3C:

          Floats, absolutely positioned elements, inline-blocks, table-cells, table-captions, and elements with ‘overflow’ other than ‘visible’ (except when that value has been propagated to the viewport) establish new block formatting contexts.
          In simpler words, as we can see in the above diagram, all the boxes that belong to a block formatting context are aligned left (for left-to-right formatting) and their left outer edge touches the left edge of the containing block.

          <li>What are the various clearing techniques and which is appropriate for what context?</li>
          1. clear: both;

          2. The Empty Div Method is, quite literally, an empty div. &lt;div style="clear: both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;. Sometimes you'll see a <br> element or some other random element used, but div is the most common because it has no browser default styling, doesn't have any special function, and is unlikely to be generically styled with CSS.

          3. The Overflow Method relies on setting the overflow CSS property on a parent element. If this property is set to auto or hidden on the parent element, the parent will expand to contain the floats, effectively clearing it for succeeding elements. This method can be beautifully semantic as it may not require an additional elements. 

          4. The Easy Clearing Method uses a clever CSS pseudo selector (:after) to clear floats. Rather than setting the overflow on the parent, you apply an additional class like "clearfix" to it. Then apply this CSS:

          <li>Explain CSS sprites, and how you would implement them on a page or site.</li>
          An image sprite is a collection of images put into a single image. A web page with many images can take a long time to load and generates multiple server requests. Using image sprites will reduce the number of server requests and save bandwidth.

          <br/>

          when you place the mouse pointer over the browser icons in non-sprite version for the first time the hover image will appear after some time, it happens because the hover image is loaded from the server on mouse hover, since the normal and hover images are two different images.
          Whereas in sprite version, since all images are combined in a single image the hover image is displayed immediately on mouse hover that results in smooth hover effect.<br/><br/>
          First of all, we will create the class .sprite that will load our sprite image. This is to avoid repetition, because all items share the same background-image.<br/><br/>
          .sprite {
          background: url("images/mySprite.png") no-repeat;
        }<br/><br/>
        Now, we must define a class for each item we want to display. For example, to display Internet Explorer icon form the image sprite the CSS code would be.
        <br/><br/>
        .ie {
        width: 50px; /* Icon width */
        height: 50px; /* Icon height */
        display: inline-block; /* Display icon as inline block */
        background-position: 0 -200px; /* Icon background position in sprite */
      }

      <li>What are your favourite image replacement techniques and which do you use when?</li>
      CSS image replacement is a technique of replacing a text element (usually a header tag) with an image. An example of this would be including a logo on a page. You may want to use a &lt;h1&gt; tag and text for this for the accessibility and SEO benefits, but ideally you'd like to show your logo, not text.<br/><br/>

<li>How would you approach fixing browser-specific styling issues?</li>
To target IE using conditional comments, just add this line to the >head&lt; tags of your HTML file:<br/><br/>

&lt;!--[if IE 6]&gt;&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="http://mysite.com/path/to/ie6.css" type="text/css" media="screen, projection"&gt;&lt;![endif]--&gt; &lt;!--[if IE 7]&gt;&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="http://mysite.com/path/to/ie7.css" type="text/css" media="screen, projection"&gt;&lt;![endif]--&gt;

<li>How do you serve your pages for feature-constrained browsers?
</li>

Progressive enhancement is a strategy for web design that emphasizes core webpage content first. This strategy then progressively adds more nuanced and technically rigorous layers of presentation and features on top of the content as the end-user's browser/internet connection allow.<br/><br/>
Graceful degradation is the ability of a computer, machine, electronic system or network to maintain limited functionality even when a large portion of it has been destroyed or rendered inoperative. The purpose of graceful degradation is to prevent catastrophic failure.

<li>What techniques/processes do you use?</li>


<li>What are the different ways to visually hide content (and make it available only for screen readers)?</li>
text-indent: -10000px;<br/><br/>
This approach moves the content to the left 10000 pixels - thus off the visible screen. The actual value matters little, so long as it is positioned off-screen. Screen readers will still read text with this style. 


<li>Have you ever used a grid system, and if so, what do you prefer?</li>
Bootstrap, Materialize
<li>Have you used or implemented media queries or mobile specific layouts/CSS</li>
There is a special meta tag you can append into the document header which resets this in most Android and iPhone devices.

<br/><br/>
&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=0;" /&gt;

<br/>
<br/>
img { max-width: 100%; }
<br/>
<br/>
Media Queries<br/>
<br/>
@media only screen<br/>
and (min-device-width : 320px) <br/>
and (max-device-width : 480px) {<br/>
}<br/>


<li>Are you familiar with styling SVG?</li>
&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" version="1.1" width="300px" height="300px" viewBox="0 0 300 300"&gt;
&lt;polygon
fill = "#FF931E"
stroke = "#ED1C24"
stroke-width = "5"
points = "279.1,160.8 195.2,193.3 174.4,280.8   117.6,211.1 27.9,218.3 76.7,142.7 42.1,59.6 129.1,82.7 197.4,24.1 202.3,114 "/&gt;
&lt;/svg&gt;<br/><br/>
The fill, stroke and stroke-width attributes are presentation attributes.

<li>How do you optimize your webpages for print?</li>
1. Of course you have at least one stylesheet to control the layout of the page and formatting of the content, but do you have a stylesheet to control how your page will look like in print? Add the print style sheet, with the media attribute set to "print", at the end of the list of stylesheets in the header. This will allow you to create custom CSS classes applied only at the time of print. Make sure your structure CSS file is given a media attribute of "all."<br/><br/>
2. Avoid Unnecessary HTML Tables<br/><br/>
3. Know Which Portions Of The Page Don't Have Any Print Value<br/>
.no-print   { display:none; }<br/><br/>
4. Use Page Breaks<br/><br/>
.page-break { page-break-before: always; } /* put this class into your main.css file with "display:none;" */<br/><br/>
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Fusce eu felis. Curabitur sit amet magna. Nullam aliquet. Aliquam ut diam...<br/>
&lt;div class="page-break"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<br/>
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit....

<li>What are some of the "gotchas" for writing efficient CSS?</li><br/>
Primarily about efficient css selectors<br/><br/>

- Avoid key selectors that match large numbers of elements (tag and universal selectors)<br/>

- Prefer class and ID selectors over tag selectors<br/>

- Avoid redundant selectors<br/>

- Preferably don't use * (universal selector)<br/>


*And like any other code, try group and reuse common properties.<br/>

<li>What are the advantages/disadvantages of using CSS preprocessors?</li>
Advantages<br/>
- better oranization from nesting them<br/>
- ability to define variables and mixins<br/>
- have mathematical functions<br/>
- joining multiple files<br/>
- in some cases, cleaner syntaxes<br/><br/>

Disadvantages<br/>
- mainly for designers not comfortable on the command line or programming concepts
<li>Describe what you like and dislike about the CSS preprocessors you have used.</li>

<li>How would you implement a web design comp that uses non-standard fonts?</li>
using @font-face<br/>
@font-face is a css rule which allows you to download a particular font from your server to render a webpage if the user hasn't got that font installed. This means that web designers will no longer have to adhere to a particular set of "web safe" fonts that the user has pre-installed on their computer.<br/><br/>
using font service link<br/>
&lt;link href='http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'&gt;

<li>Explain how a browser determines what elements match a CSS selector.</li>
One of the important things to understand about how browsers read your CSS selectors, is that they read them from right to left. That means that in the selector ul > li a[title=”home”] the first thing thing interpreted is a[title=”home”]. This first part is also referred to as the “key selector” in that ultimately, it is the element being selected.
<br/>
<li>Describe pseudo-elements and discuss what they are used for.</li>
A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to selectors that specifies a special state of the element to be selected. For example :hover will apply a style when the user hovers over the element specified by the selector.<br/><br/>
:link - Perhaps the most confusion-causing link-related pseudo selector. Aren't all &lt;a&gt; links? Well not if they don't have an href attribute. This selects only those that do, thus is essentially the same as a[href]. This selector will become a lot more useful should any-element linking become reality.<br/><br/>
:hover - When the mouse cursor rolls over a link, that link is in it's hover state and this will select it.
<br/><br/>
:active - Selects the link while it is being activated (being clicked on or otherwise activated). For example, for the "pressed" state of a button-style link or to make all links feel more button-like.<br/><br/>
:focus - Defining hover styles for links is great, but it doesn't help out those who used keyboard navigation to get to the link. :focus will select links that are the current focus of the keyboard. This is not limited to links, but can be used (and really should be used) on inputs and textareas as well. Some would tell you to define a :focus style for anything that has a :hover style.
<br/><br/>
:visited - Selects links that have already been visited by the current browser.

<li>Explain your understanding of the box model and how you would tell the browser in CSS to render your layout in different box models.</li>
All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around HTML elements, and it consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.

When you set the width and height properties of an element with CSS, you just set the width and height of the content area. To calculate the full size of an element, you must also add the padding, borders and margins.
<li>What does * { box-sizing: border-box; } do? What are its advantages?</li>
box-sizing property:<br/>

content-box – (default) element width doesn’t include padding and border<br/>
border-box –  element width includes padding and borders
<li>List as many values for the display property that you can remember.</li>
none<br/>
inherit<br/>
inline<br/>
inline-block<br/>
block<br/>
table<br/>
table-cell<br/>
<li>What's the difference between inline and inline-block?</li>
Inline:<br/><br/>

respects left and right margins and padding<br/>
doesn’t respect top and bottom  margins and padding<br/>
doesn’t have a width and height<br/>
allow other elements to sit to its left and right<br/><br/>
Block:<br/>

respects all margins and paddings<br/>
respects width and height<br/>
line break after<br/><br/>
Inline-block:<br/>

placed like an inline element (on the same line) but behaves as block<br/>
respects all margins and paddings<br/>
respects width and height<br/>
allow other elements to sit to its left and right<br/>

<li>What's the difference between a relative, fixed, absolute and statically positioned element?</li>
Absolute<br/>

displayed on the page in relation to the document, or a parent element with a positioning different from static<br/>
using top, left, bottom and right CSS properties, exact position can be specified<br/><br/>
Fixed<br/>

position in relation to the browser window<br/>
allows to display toolbars, buttons or navigation menus, which are anchored at a fixed position and scroll with the page<br/><br/>
Relative<br/>

moves an element from its normal position with the top, left, bottom and right CSS properties<br/><br/>
Static
<br/>
means that every element is positioned in the natural order it is added to the page

<li>The 'C' in CSS stands for Cascading. How is priority determined in assigning styles (a few examples)? How can you use this system to your advantage?</li>
CSS priority is determined by specificity and inheritance.<br/>

Specificity: ID → class, psuedo-class → element, psudo-element<br/><br/>
Inheritence: specified value → computed value → used value → actual value

<li>What existing CSS frameworks have you used locally, or in production? How would you change/improve them?</li>
Bootstrap, Materialize
<li>Have you played around with the new CSS Flexbox or Grid specs?</li>
Flexbox a bit
<li>How is responsive design different from adaptive design?</li>
Adaptive Web Design. Adaptive web design is different from responsive design in that there isn't one layout that always changes. Instead, there are several distinct layouts for multiple screen sizes. And the layout used depends on the screen size used.
<li>Have you ever worked with retina graphics? If so, when and what techniques did you use?</li>

<li>Is there any reason you'd want to use translate() instead of absolute positioning, or vice-versa? And why?</li>
Yes, translate do not cause the browser to trigger repaint and layout and instead only acts on the compositor. I tend to only ever use translate/transform nowadays, and only using absolute positioning for an elements initial position. I'll then translate it from that initial position for better performance.

<h1>JS QUESTIONS</h1>

<ul>

  <li>Explain event delegation</li>
  Event delegation refers to the process of using event propagation (bubbling) to handle events at a higher level in the DOM than the element on which the event originated. It allows us to attach a single event listener for elements that exist now or in the future. <br/><br/>

  In traditional event handling you add or remove event handlers from each element as needed. However, event handlers can potentially cause of memory leaks and performance degradation — the more you have, the greater the risk. JavaScript event delegation is a simple technique by which you add a single event handler to a parent element in order to avoid having to add event handlers to multiple child elements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There are less event handlers to setup and reside in memory. This is the big one; better performance and less crashing.<br/>
There’s no need to re-attach handlers after a DOM update. If your page content is generated dynamically, via Ajax for example, you don’t need to add and remove event handlers as elements are loaded or unloaded.

  <li>Explain how this works in JavaScript</li>
  Event delegation makes use of two often overlooked features of JavaScript events: event bubbling and the target element. When an event is triggered on an element, for example a mouse click on a button, the same event is also triggered on all of that element’s ancestors. This process is known as event bubbling; the event bubbles up from the originating element to the top of the DOM tree. The target element of any event is the originating element, the button in our example, and is stored in a property of the event object. Using event delegation it’s possible to add an event handler to an element, wait for an event to bubble up from a child element and easily determine from which element the event originated.

  <li>Explain how prototypal inheritance works</li>
  Prototype-based programming is a style of object-oriented programming in which behaviour reuse (known as inheritance) is performed via a process of reusing existing objects via delegation that serve as prototypes. This model can also be known as prototypal, prototype-oriented, classless, or instance-based programming.<br/>
  The object function untangles JavaScript's constructor pattern, achieving true prototypal inheritance. It takes an old object as a parameter and returns an empty new object that inherits from the old one. If we attempt to obtain a member from the new object, and it lacks that key, then the old object will supply the member. Objects inherit from objects. What could be more object oriented than that?



  <br/>
  <br/>
  // Declaring our Animal object<br/>
var Animal = function () {<br/>
<br/>
    this.name = 'unknown';<br/>
<br/>
    this.getName = function () {<br/>
        return this.name;<br/>
    }<br/>
<br/>
    return this;<br/>
};<br/>
<br/>
// Declaring our Dog object<br/>
var Dog = function () {<br/>
<br/>
    // A private variable here        <br/>
    var private = 42;<br/><br/>

    // overriding the name<br/>
    this.name = "Bello";<br/><br/>
<br/>
    // Implementing ".bark()"<br/>
    this.bark = function () {<br/>
        return 'MEOW';<br/>
    }  <br/><br/>

    return this;<br/>
};<br/><br/>


// Dog extends animal<br/>
Dog.prototype = new Animal();<br/>
<br/><br/>
// -- Done declaring --<br/>
<br/>
// Creating an instance of Dog.<br/>
var dog = new Dog();<br/><br/>

// Proving our case<br/>
console.log(<br/>
    "Is dog an instance of Dog? ", dog instanceof Dog, "\n",<br/>
    "Is dog an instance of Animal? ", dog instanceof Animal, "\n",<br/>
    dog.bark() +"\n", // Should be: "MEOW"<br/>
    dog.getName() +"\n", // Should be: "Bello"<br/>
    dog.private +"\n" // Should be: 'undefined'<br/>
);<br/><br/>

  <li>What do you think of AMD vs CommonJS?</li>
  Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD) AMD was born out of a group of developers that were displeased with the direction adopted by CommonJS. In fact, AMD was split from CommonJS early in its development. The main difference between AMD and CommonJS lies in its support for asynchronous module loading.

  <li>Explain why the following doesn't work as an IIFE: function foo(){ }();.</li>
  IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined.<br/>
  This is a function definition, it defines foo. But it’s not a function expression - that is, it’s not understood by the JS parser to actually call a function.<br/>
  In order to prep the parser that we're actually dealing with a function expression we have to wrap things up in () like so:
<br/><br/>

(<br/>
  function foo(){<br/>
  }()<br/>
);



  <li>What needs to be changed to properly make it an IIFE?</li>
   In order to prep the parser that we're actually dealing with a function expression we have to wrap things up in () like so:
<br/><br/>

(<br/>
  function foo(){<br/>
  }()<br/>
);


  <li>What's the difference between a variable that is: null, undefined or undeclared?</li>
  In JavaScript null is "nothing". It is supposed to be something that doesn't exist.
<br/>
Unfortunately, in JavaScript, the data type of null is an object.
<br/><br/>
The undefined property indicates that a variable has not been assigned a value.
<br/><br/>
A variable is undeclared when it does not use the var keyword. It gets created on the global object (that is, the window), thus it operates in a different space as the declared variables.

  <li>How would you go about checking for any of these states?</li>
  The typeof operator returns a string indicating the type of the unevaluated operand.

  <li>What is a closure, and how/why would you use one?</li>

  Global variables can be made local (private) with closures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  var add = (function () {<br/>
    var counter = 0;<br/>
    return function () {return counter += 1;}<br/>
})();<br/>
<br/>
add();<br/>
add();<br/>
add();<br/><br/>
// the counter is now 3<br/><br/>
Example Explained<br/>
The variable add is assigned the return value of a self-invoking function.<br/>

The self-invoking function only runs once. It sets the counter to zero (0), and returns a function expression.<br/>

This way add becomes a function. The "wonderful" part is that it can access the counter in the parent scope.<br/>

This is called a JavaScript closure. It makes it possible for a function to have "private" variables.<br/>

The counter is protected by the scope of the anonymous function, and can only be changed using the add function.<br/>



  <li>What's a typical use case for anonymous functions?</li>
  Anonymous functions are created at runtime. The function operator can be used anywhere that it's valid to use an expression. For example you can use the function operator when a variable is being assigned, when a parameter is being passed to a function or in a return statement.
  <br/>
  I would say that the most typical use for anonymous functions in JS is to pass them as arguments to other functions. Take the setTimeout function for example:<br/>
  setTimeout(function() {<br/>
  alert('hello'); <br/>
}, 1000);<br/><br/>
Another popular use case (especially for frameworks) is to create closures with anonymous functions:<br/><br/>
(function() {<br/>
  alert('foo'); <br/>
})();

  <li>How do you organize your code? (module pattern, classical inheritance?)</li>

  <li>What's the difference between host objects and native objects?</li>
native object<br/><br/>

object in an ECMAScript implementation whose semantics are fully defined by this specification rather than by the host environment.<br/><br/>

NOTE Standard native objects are defined in this specification. Some native objects are built-in; others may be constructed during the course of execution of an ECMAScript program.<br/><br/>


host object<br/><br/>

object supplied by the host environment to complete the execution environment of ECMAScript.<br/>

NOTE Any object that is not native is a host object.
A few examples:<br/><br/>

Native objects: Object (constructor), Date, Math, parseInt, eval, string methods like indexOf and replace, array methods, ...<br/>

Host objects (assuming browser environment): window, document, location, history, XMLHttpRequest, setTimeout, getElementsByTagName, querySelectorAll


  <li>Difference between: function Person(){}, var person = Person(), and var person = new Person()?</li>
  1. function Person() {} <br/><br/>
Declares a function (but does not execute it).<br/>
It will usually have some code between the curly brackets.
<br/><br/>
2. var person = Person()<br/>
Declares a variable (person), invokes a function (Person) and sets the value of person to the return of the function.
<br/><br/>
3. var person = new Person()<br/>
Creates a new instance of an object based on the Person function. So the variable (person) is now an Object, not just a string or a number.
<br/><br/>
Objects can contain indexed strings, numbers and even functions, and you can add more stuff to them, they're pretty awesome. The whole concept of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is based on this.

  <li>What's the difference between .call and .apply?</li>

  var person1 = {name: 'Marvin', age: 42, size: '2xM'};<br/>
var person2 = {name: 'Zaphod', age: 42000000000, size: '1xS'};<br/>
<br/>
var sayHello = function(){<br/>
    alert('Hello, ' + this.name);<br/>
};<br/>

var sayGoodbye = function(){<br/>
    alert('Goodbye, ' + this.name);<br/>
};<br/><br/>

writing the following code:
<br/><br/>
sayHello();<br/>
sayGoodbye();<br/><br/>
will give errors<br/>This is because both functions rely on their scope for the this.name data, and calling them without explicit scope will just run them in the scope of the current window.<br/><br/>

So how do we scope them? Try this:<br/><br/>

sayHello.call(person1);<br/>
sayGoodbye.call(person2);<br/><br/>

sayHello.apply(person1);<br/>
sayGoodbye.apply(person2);<br/><br/>

All four of these lines do exactly the same thing. The run sayHello or sayGoodbye in the scope of either person1 or person2.<br/><br/>
Both call and apply perform very similar functions: they execute a function in the context, or scope, of the first argument that you pass to them. Also, they're both functions that can only be called on other functions.<br/><br/>

var say = function(greeting){<br/>
    alert(greeting + ', ' + this.name);<br/>
};<br/><br/>

say.call(person1, 'Hello');<br/>
say.call(person2, 'Goodbye');<br/><br/>
So that's call for you. It runs the function in the context of the first argument, and subsequent arguments are passed in to the function to work with.  <br/><br/>
The limitations of call quickly become apparent when you want to write code that doesn't (or shouldn't) know the number of arguments that the functions need… like a dispatcher.<br/><br/>

var dispatch = function(person, method, args){<br/>
    method.apply(person, args);<br/>
};<br/><br/>

dispatch(person1, say, ['Hello']);<br/>
dispatch(person2, update, ['Slarty', 200, '1xM']);<br/><br/>
So that's where apply comes in - the second argument needs to be an array, which is unpacked into arguments that are passed to the called function.
<br/><br/>
So that's the difference between call and apply. Both can be called on functions, which they run in the context of the first argument. In call the subsequent arguments are passed in to the function as they are, while apply expects the second argument to be an array that it unpacks as arguments for the called function.

  <li>Explain Function.prototype.bind.</li>

  the problem of how to keep the context of this within another function, then you might not realize that what you actually need is Function.prototype.bind().<br/><br/>

  var foo = {<br/>
    x: 3<br/>
}<br/><br/>

var bar = function(){<br/>
    console.log(this.x);<br/>
}<br/><br/>

bar(); // undefined<br/><br/>

var boundFunc = bar.bind(foo);<br/><br/>

boundFunc(); // 3<br/><br/>

  <li>When would you use document.write()?</li>

  document.write() shouldn’t be used after the page has loaded to change the content as it will overwrite the entire page 
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It seems that the only “approved” time to use document.write() is for third party code to be included (such as ads or Google Analytics). Since document.write() is always available (mostly) it is a good choice for third party vendors to use it to add their scripts. They don’t know what environment you're using, if jQuery is or isn’t available, or what your onload events are. And with document.write() they don’t have to.

  <li>What's the difference between feature detection, feature inference, and using the UA string?</li>

  What is feature detection? <br/> <br/>

When you check if a certain feature exists, that’s feature detection. <br/> <br/>

We need to write code that checks if features exist in JS since different browsers have different implementations, something like this: <br/> <br/>

var text; <br/>
if(typeof(Text) === "function"){ <br/>
    text = new Text('Oh, how quick that fox was!'); <br/>
} else { <br/>
    text = 'Oh, how quick that fox was!'; <br/>
} <br/>

That means you can be confident you've covered all of your bases with different browser implementations. <br/> <br/>


What is feature inference?<br/><br/>

When you make an assumption that because one feature is present (or not) another one will also be present (or not).<br/><br/>

Chrome implements the Text function. I also know Chrome doesn’t have applyElement like IE does. So I'll write code like...<br/><br/>

if(typeof applyElement != 'undefined') {<br/>
    // now I know I'm not in IE, I'll just assume Text is available<br/>
    text = new Text('Oh, how quick that fox was!');<br/>
}<br/><br/>

But oops! Someone looked at that code in Firefox which doesn’t implement applyElement or Text! They got an error :(<br/><br/>

So that’s the problem. Since you're not checking for the feature you're using you're more likely to have inconsistencies. Also, if in the future one of the browsers changes what they implement all your assumptions will be inacurate.
<br/><br/>
What is the UA string?<br/><br/>

“UA” stands for user agent, which means the browser (and a whole lot of other stuff). Mine looks like this:<br/>


Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_5) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/39.0.2171.71
<br/><br/>
(You can find your user string at whatsmyuseragent.com.)<br/><br/>

But you can see in there (at the end) it says what browser I’m on. So it would be possible to check for a specific version of Chrome by “sniffing” the user agent string. This is generally considered bad practice (but seems to be slightly better practice than feature inference).<br/><br/>

Just like with feature inference, if you use the UA string you're making an assumption about how the string will be written, what changes are likely to happen in this particular version, and that your code will be able to handle any future changes.

  <li>Explain AJAX in as much detail as possible.</li>

  AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML. In a nutshell, it is the use of the XMLHttpRequest object to communicate with servers. It can send and receive information in various formats, including JSON, XML, HTML, and text files.<br/><br/>
  Update a web page without reloading the page<br/>
Request data from a server - after the page has loaded<br/>
Receive data from a server - after the page has loaded<br/>
Send data to a server - in the background<br/>

  <li>Explain how JSONP works (and how it's not really AJAX).</li>

What is JSONP?<br/><br/>
If you spend some time thinking about how JavaScript operates in a browser, you will probably arrive at the realization that the policy does not seem to effect script tags. Specifically, how many of us get JQuery from the Google CDN or some other source that is not the same origin as our current page? (I hope that answer is “most”, by the way.)
<br/><br/>
That same logic, combined with some DOM knowledge, would probably lead you to experiment with loading other types of JavaScript, aside from a library, using script tags. Since JavaScript has a global scope, if you were to reference a function that could handle that data you could then link it with your application and do something interesting with it.
<br/><br/>
JSONP is born.
<br/><br/>
The idea of JSONP is actually pretty simple: toss a script tag into the DOM with a reference to a resource that returns JSON data. Have the server return said JSON with “padding” (the “P” part of JSONP) that executes a function wrapping the incoming data. In order for this to work properly, the server API must also support JSONP. Typically, the function name is named as the callback parameter. For example, let’s pretend you are accessing a service that returns JSON weather information that looks like:
<br/><br/>
http://www.weather.com/90210<br/><br/>
Which returns JSON like:<br/><br/>

{"zipCode": "90210","location": "Beverly Hills","high": "85 degrees","low": "55 degrees"}<br/><br/>
Adding JSONP support would result in a URL that looks like:
<br/><br/>
http://www.weather.com/90210?callback=MyCallback
And returns:<br/><br/>

MyCallback({"zipCode": "90210","location": "Beverly Hills","high": "85 degrees","low": "55 degrees"});
<br/><br/>

An ajax call is an actual HTTP request from your client directly to a server. Ajax calls can be synchronous (blocking until they complete) or asynchronous. Because of same-origin security protections, ajax calls can only be made to the same server that the web page came from unless the target server explicitly allows a cross origin request using CORS.<br/><br/>

JSONP calls are an interesting hack with the &lt;script&gt; tag that allows cross-origin communication. In a JSONP call, the client creates a script tag and puts a URL on it with an callback=xxxx query parameter on it. That script request (via the script tag insertion) is sent by the browser to the foreign server. The browser just thinks it's requesting some javascript code.
<br/><br/>
So, the two communication methods work completely differently. Only ajax calls can be synchronous. By the nature of the &lt;script&gt; tag insertion, JSONP calls are always asynchronous.
<br/><br/>
In an Ajax call, the response comes back in a ajax event handler.
<br/><br/>
In a JSONP call, the response comes when the returned Javascript calls a function of yours.
<br/><br/>
In some ways, JSONP is a security hole that bypasses the cross-origin security mechanism. But, you can only call servers that explicitly choose to support a JSONP-like mechanism so if a server doesn't want you to be able to call it cross-origin, it can prevent it by not supporting JSONP. You can't make regular ajax calls to these other servers.

  <li>Have you ever used JavaScript templating?</li>
<br/><br/>
  (i.e, mustache.js, Handlebars.js, )
<br/><br/>
  <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/overview-javascript-templating-engines/" title="">More on templating</a>

  <li>If so, what libraries have you used?</li>

  <li>Explain "hoisting".</li>

  JavaScript Declarations are Hoisted<br/>
In JavaScript, a variable can be declared after it has been used.<br/>

In other words; a variable can be used before it has been declared.<br/>
Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of the current scope (to the top of the current script or the current function).
<br/><br/>
x = 5; // Assign 5 to x<br/><br/>

elem = document.getElementById("demo"); // Find an element <br/>
elem.innerHTML = x;                     // Display x in the element<br/>
<br/><br/>
var x; // Declare x
<br/><br/>
only the declaration (var x) , not the initialization (x = 5)  is hoisted to the top.

  <li>Describe event bubbling.</li>
  Bubbling<br/>

The bubbling principle is simple.<br/>

When an event happens on an element, it first runs the handlers on it, then on its parent, then all the way up on other ancestors.<br/>
<br/><br/>
Let’s say, we have 3 nested elements FORM > DIV > P with a handler on each of them:<br/><br/>



&lt;form onclick="alert('form')"&gt;FORM<br/>
  &lt;div onclick="alert('div')"&gt;DIV<br/>
    &lt;p onclick="alert('p')"&gt;P&lt;/p&gt;<br/>
  &lt;/div&gt;<br/>
&lt;/form&gt;<br/><br/>

So if we click on &lt;p&gt;, then we’ll see 3 alerts: p → div → form.<br/><br/>

The process is called “bubbling”, because events “bubble” from the inner element up through parents like a bubble in the water.<br/>

  <li>What's the difference between an "attribute" and a "property"?</li>

  What is a property?<br/><br/>

JS DOM objects have properties. These properties are kind of like instance variables for the particular element. As such, a property can be different types (boolean, string, etc.). Properties can be accessed using jQuery’s prop method (as seen below) and also by interacting with the object in vanilla JS.
<br/><br/>
Let’s take a look:<br/><br/>

&lt;a href='page2.html' class='link classes' name='linkName' id='linkID'&gt;Hi&lt;/a&gt;<br/><br/>

$('#linkID').prop('href'); // returns "http://example.com/page2.html"<br/>
$('#linkID').prop('name'); // returns "linkName"<br/>
$('#linkID').prop('id'); // returns "linkID"<br/>
$('#linkID').prop('className'); // returns "link classes"<br/><br/>

What is an attribute?<br/><br/>

Attributes are in the HTML itself, rather than in the DOM. They are very similar to properties, but not quite as good. When a property is available it’s recommended that you work with properties rather than attributes.
<br/><br/>
An attribute is only ever a string, no other type.<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
&lt;input type="checkbox" checked=true/&gt;<br/><br/>

$('input').prop('checked'); // returns true<br/>
$('input').attr('checked'); // returns "checked"<br/><br/>

If an element has a default value, the attribute shows the default value even if the value has changed.<br/><br/>

&lt;input type="text" name="username" value="user123"&gt;<br/><br/>

$('input').prop('value', '456user');<br/>
$('input').prop('value'); // returns "456user"<br/>
$('input').attr('value'); // returns "user123"<br/>

  <li>Why is extending built-in JavaScript objects not a good idea?</li>
  Why is extending built in JavaScript objects not a good idea?
Turns out there’s lots written on this topic (lucky for me!), be sure to check out the references section at the end.<br/><br/>

What is “extending an object”?<br/><br/>

When you add functionality to an object using the prototype. An example looks like this:<br/><br/>

Array.prototype.first = function(){<br/>
    return this[0];<br/>
}<br/><br/>

var temp = [1, 2, 3];<br/>
temp.first(); // returns 1<br/><br/>

At first glance, this seems like such an awesome feature. Want the third element from an array? Extend Array! Want strings to have a titleize method? Extend String! Want alphabetisedProperties available for objects? Extend Object!<br/><br/>

Why is this a bad thing?<br/><br/>

It depends on who you ask. This is one of those “JS standards” - unlike most of the questions that have a clear answer, this one has a bit more opinion.
<br/><br/>
The main argument against doing this is: if, in future, a browser decides to implement its own version of your method, your method might get overridden (silently) and the browser’s implementation (which is probably different from yours) would take over. So not extending in the first place is future proofing your code.<br/><br/>

  When you extend an object, you change its behaviour.<br/>

Changing the behaviour of an object that will only be used by your own code is fine. But when you change the behaviour of something that is also used by other code there is a risk you will break that other code.

  <li>Difference between document load event and document ready event?</li>
The ready event occurs after the HTML document has been loaded, while the onload event occurs later, when all content (e.g. images) also has been loaded. The onload event is a standard event in the DOM, while the ready event is specific to jQuery.

  <li>What is the difference between == and ===?</li>

  JavaScript has both strict and type-converting equality comparison. For strict equality the objects being compared must have the same type and:
<br/><br/>
Two strings are strictly equal when they have the same sequence of characters, same length, and same characters in corresponding positions.<br/><br/>
Two numbers are strictly equal when they are numerically equal (have the same number value). NaN is not equal to anything, including NaN. Positive and negative zeros are equal to one another.<br/><br/>
Two Boolean operands are strictly equal if both are true or both are false.
Two objects are strictly equal if they refer to the same Object.<br/><br/>
Null and Undefined types are == (but not ===). [I.e. (Null==Undefined) is true but (Null===Undefined) is false]

  <li>Explain the same-origin policy with regards to JavaScript.</li>

  The same-origin policy helps prevent malicious attacks by stopping code from another site executing on your site. An attacks like this is known as a Cross Site Scripting attack.<br/><br/>

How does JS decide if it’s a “same” site?<br/><br/>

The “origin” is the same if three things are the same: the protocol (http vs. https), the domain (subdomain.yoursite.com vs. yoursite.com vs. google.com), and the port (:80 vs. :4567). If all three of these line up, then JS views the sites as the same, and code is executed. If any of them are different then the code is marked as potentially malicious and is not run.

  <li>Make this work:
    duplicate([1,2,3,4,5]); // [1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,5]</li>

function myFunction(x) {<br/><br/>

var newerArray = [];<br/><br/>

for(i=0; i<x.length; i++){<br/>
  newerArray.push(x[i]);<br/>
}<br/><br/>

for(i=0; i < x.length; i++){<br/>
  newerArray.push(x[i]);<br/>
}<br/><br/>

return newerArray;<br/>
}<br/><br/>

myFunction([1,2,3,4,5]); //[1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,5]<br/><br/>

    <li>Why is it called a Ternary expression, what does the word "Ternary" indicate?</li>

    a ternary operand accepts three parameters.<br/><br/>

In programming the ternary operand we use is a rewrite of an if statement. Before we write an actual ternary, we'll just take a quick look at an if statement:<br/><br/>

if(conditional) { // one<br/>
    truethy_block // two<br/>
} else {<br/>
    falsey_block // three<br/>
}<br/><br/>

You can see there are three sections to an if statement. Let’s write them as a property ternary expression:<br/><br/>

conditional ? truethy_block : falsey_block<br/><br/>


    <li>What is "use strict";? what are the advantages and disadvantages to using it?</li>

If you put "use strict"; at the top of your code (or function), then the JS is evaluated in strict mode. Strict mode throws more errors and disables some features in an effort to make your code more robust, readable, and accurate.
<br/><br/>
Advantages<br/><br/>

Strict mode helps out in a couple ways:<br/><br/>

Prevents undelared variables, which would have global scope.<br/>
It catches some common coding bloopers, throwing exceptions.<br/>
It prevents, or throws errors, when relatively “unsafe” actions are taken (such as gaining access to the global object).<br/>
It disables features that are confusing or poorly thought out.<br/><br/>

I had a harder time finding why people don’t like strict mode. The best explanation I found was when code mixed strict and “normal” modes. If a developer used a library that was in strict mode, but the developer was used to working in normal mode, they might call some actions on the library that wouldn’t work as expected. Worse, since the developer is in normal mode, they don’t have the advantages of extra errors being thrown, so the error might fail silently.<br/><br/>

Also, as listed above, strict mode stops you from doing certain things. People generally think that you shouldn’t use those things in the first place, but some developers don’t like the constraint and want to use all the features of the language.<br/><br/>

    <li>Create a for loop that iterates up to 100 while outputting "fizz" at multiples of 3, "buzz" at multiples of 5 and "fizzbuzz" at multiples of 3 and 5</li>

function fizzBuzz() {<br/><br/>

for(i=1;i<=100;i++){<br/>
  if(i % 3 === 0 && i % 5 === 0){<br/>
    console.log("FIZZBUZZ");<br/>
  }else if(i % 3 === 0){<br/>
    console.log("BUZZ");<br/>
  }else if( i % 5 === 0){<br/>
    console.log("FIZZ");<br/>
  }else{<br/>
    console.log(i);<br/>
  }<br/>
}<br/>
}<br/><br/>

fizzBuzz();

    <li>Why is it, in general, a good idea to leave the global scope of a website as-is and never touch it?</li>

    Form most languages, global variables are considered a “bad thing”. JS is no different, but it probably has more severe consequences than most languages.<br/><br/>

Some points on why global variables are generally bad.<br/><br/>

It’s harder to read the code and reason about it when variables seem to appear out of thin air (but really from the global scope).<br/><br/>
Anyone can update a global variable from any point in the program at any time (and from any thread if there’s more than one going).<br/><br/>
General code smell - if you're too lazy to put the variable only where it needs to be then what other corners are you cutting?<br/><br/>
It’s probable that you'll encounter global variable name clashes. Since there’s only one namespace you're more likely to double up on a variable name.

    <li>Why would you use something like the load event? Does this event have disadvantages? Do you know any alternatives, and why would you use those?</li>

    Execute a JavaScript immediately after a page has been loaded:<br/><br/>

    onload is most often used within the &lt;body&gt; element to execute a script once a web page has completely loaded all content (including images, script files, CSS files, etc.).<br/><br/>

    object.onload = function(){myScript};<br/><br/>


If you're ok with putting javascript inside the &lt;body&gt; tag then a fairly reliable way of running javascript after the entire page has loaded is placing your javascript in &lt;script&gt; tags at the very bottom of the page.

    <li>Explain what a single page app is and how to make one SEO-friendly.</li>

    Single-Page Applications (SPAs) are Web apps that load a single HTML page and dynamically update that page as the user interacts with the app. SPAs use AJAX and HTML5 to create fluid and responsive Web apps, without constant page reloads. However, this means much of the work happens on the client side, in JavaScript.<br/><br/>

    However, relying heavily on JavaScript to render your page content and provide navigation functionality brings with it well-known risks in terms of technical SEO, indexing and linkability challenges.<br/><br/>

    The downside is that the crucial content or key product data may not be visible to search engines, which often will not parse the JavaScript. As the hashtag part of a URL is visible to the local browser but not the server, standard bot indexing practices that follow links fail in the absence of a sophisticated emulation of the JavaScript logic by the indexing robot.
<br/><br/>
    One Solution: Fallback Pages<br/><br/>

Fallback pages are HTML pages that display if the requesting resource does not parse JavaScript. They are typically static pages that attempt to replicate the functionality and content of the JavaScript web application via server-side rendered pages. These pages hold the same content the Javascript application would show as well as using standard indexable links for navigation.

    <li>What is the extent of your experience with Promises and/or their polyfills?</li>


What is a promise?<br/><br/>
The core idea behind promises is that a promise represents the result of an asynchronous operation. A promise is in one of three different states:
<br/><br/>
pending - The initial state of a promise.<br/>
fulfilled - The state of a promise representing a successful operation.<br/>
rejected - The state of a promise representing a failed operation.<br/><br/>

Constructing a promise<br/><br/>
Once all of the APIs return promises, it should be relatively rare that you need to construct one by hand. In the meantime, we need a way to polyfill existing APIs. For example:<br/><br/>

function readFile(filename, enc){<br/>
  return new Promise(function (fulfill, reject){<br/>
    fs.readFile(filename, enc, function (err, res){<br/>
      if (err) reject(err);<br/>
      else fulfill(res);<br/>
    });<br/>
  });<br/>
}<br/><br/>

We use new Promise to construct the promise. We give the constructor a factory function which does the actual work. This function is called immediately with two arguments. The first argument fulfills the promise and the second argument rejects the promise. Once the operation has completed, we call the appropriate function.<br/><br/>
    <li>What are the pros and cons of using Promises instead of callbacks?</li>
    promises make more than one function to be called easier.<br/><br/>
Particular features are that <br/><br/>
         (a) functions can be added anywhere in the code, subject only to the promise being within scope, and<br/>
          (b) functions added after a Deferred/promise has been resolved/rejected will fire immediately.<br/><br/>

In short promises are perfect when you deal with multiple async calls in parallel.

    <li>What are some of the advantages/disadvantages of writing JavaScript code in a language that compiles to JavaScript?</li>

    Advantages:<br/><br/>

Classes. Many (most?) transpiled languages give you classes, inheritance and sometimes interfaces. The common rebuttal to this is that it’s just syntax sugar and you’ve still got JS prototypical inheritance under the hood, but that misses the point: classes are always syntax sugar. A C++ compiler isn’t generating some magic OOP machine code, it is generating standard procedural assembly code. A transpiled language is just doing the same but emitting JS instead.<br/><br/>
Types. JS vague typing and type guessing (“inference”) is a menace with a large code base. Half the unit tests in existence are there to try and plug the inability of JS to allow you to define what you mean. Most transpiled languages fix this to one degree or another thereby giving you a lot of your test suite by default and eliminating bugs before they happen. This is really why TypeScript exists.<br/><br/>
Features: JS evolves quite slowly in terms of browser implementation. If you want to use ES6 features you need to transpile to ES5 anyway. TypeScript 2 is probably ES7+ in many ways. Other languages bring other features.<br/><br/>
Disadvantages:<br/><br/>

You’ll probably need webpack or gulp to automate all your transpiling and bundling.<br/><br/>
The number of developers familiar with what you are doing is smaller.
Can’t think of another one offhand.

  <h1>TESTING QUESTIONS</h1>

  <ul>

    <li>What are some advantages/disadvantages to testing your code?</li>

    Advantages<br/><br/>

Prevent regression errors<br/>
Ensure there is no missing part to change when refactoring<br/>
Tests can be used as specs<br/>
Test process can be shared amongst team members<br/><br/>
Disadvantages: there are rarely disadvantages<br/><br/>

It may or may not take more time to prototype.

    <li>What tools would you use to test your code's functionality?</li>

    For JavaScript, the basic assert module is quite enough for simple tests. But when it gets a big and production-level project, it is a better idea to set a test framework. For backend, I usually use Mocha. For frontend, Mocha can still be used with headless browsers such as PhantomJS. There are also other famous tools like Selenium for browser tests.

    <li>What is the difference between a unit test and a functional/integration test?</li>
    A unit test is on a small unit and checks if each unit works well.<br/><br/>
A functional test is on a particular feature and check if it generates a proper output for a provided input.<br/><br/>
An integration test checks if each part(or unit) of code works well together and results in combination functions correctly.

    <li>What is the purpose of a code style linting tool?</li>

    It is to keep source codes in a repository consistent and easy to read. Linting also prevent possible mistakes developers can make. For example, some linter provides options to check which indentation should be used(it is not actually what a linter should do though). A linter can also check if there is any used variable which hasn't been declared, or if there is any unused variable. In short, linting is a kind of static analysis.
